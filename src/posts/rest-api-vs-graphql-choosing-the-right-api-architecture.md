- `import.meta.glob` is a useful Vite feature to get all the posts using a glob (`eager` reads the contents of the file avoiding `await paths[path]()`)
- I loop over the `paths` and get the slug `post.md` but replace `.md` since we only want the slug
- I'm checking if `file` has a `metadata` property inside of it and if the `slug` exists to be safe and then I'm going to get the `metadata` or **frontmatter** from the post
- I'm creating a `post` that includes `metadata` and the `slug`
- I only want to add the post if `published` is set to `true`
- sort `posts` by date and return them
